Normally, each knit of a document starts from a completely clean slate. This is great for reproducibility, because it ensures that youâ€™ve captured every important computation in code. However, it can be painful if you have some computations that take a long time. The solution is `cache = TRUE`. 

## Inline code

```{r}
comma <- function(x) format(x, digits = 2, big.mark = ",")
comma(1234567)
comma(0.234567)
```
